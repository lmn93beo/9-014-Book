    "The diagnosis of rare diseases is a classic example of how priors influence posterior probabilities. Suppose a rare disease infects 1 in 10,000 people and a test for this disease exists that is 99.9% reliable. We will take 99.9% reliable to mean that the probability of testing positive is 0.999 for infected individuals and 0.001 for healthy individuals. What then is the probability that an individual who tests positive is infected?\n",
    "\n",
    "This probability can be easily calculated using Bayes' Rule. We have two binary random variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) The individual can either have the disease $(D^+)$ or not have the disease $(D^-)$\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) The individual can either test positive $(T^+)$ or test negative $(T^-)$\n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in the probability $P(D^+ | T^+)$, the probability that a person is infected given a positive test result.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Bayes' Rule:\n",
    "$$ P(D^+ | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D^+) \\times P(D^+)}{P(T^+)} $$\n",

Even though the **likelihood** of being infected seems high given a positive test result (99.9%), there is such a strong **prior** that the person does not have the disease (0.001%), the resulting **posterior** probability of being infected is still very low.\n",
